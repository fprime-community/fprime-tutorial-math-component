# Creating Components Part 2: Implementing MathSender Behavior

## In this section 

In this section you will edit `MathSender.cpp` to implement the desired component behavior. 

As a reminder, below is the component behavior you are trying to implement in this section of the tutorial. 

## Component Description 
The `MathSender` is going to be an active component which will receive parameters, send parameters, log events, and send telemetry. 

## Editing the Do Math Command Handler

The handler `DO_MATH_handler` is called when the `MathSender` component receives a `DO_MATH` command. This handler overrides the corresponding pure virtual function in the auto-generated base class. Fill in the handler so that it looks like this:

```cpp
// In: MathSender.cpp
void MathSender ::
  DO_MATH_cmdHandler(
      const FwOpcodeType opCode,
      const U32 cmdSeq,
      F32 val1,
      MathOp op,
      F32 val2
  )
{
  this->tlmWrite_VAL1(val1);
  this->tlmWrite_OP(op);
  this->tlmWrite_VAL2(val2);
  this->log_ACTIVITY_LO_COMMAND_RECV(val1, op, val2);
  this->mathOpOut_out(0, val1, op, val2);
  this->cmdResponse_out(opCode, cmdSeq, Fw::CmdResponse::OK);
}
```
## Explanation
The first two arguments to the handler function provide the command opcode and the command sequence number (a unique identifier generated by the command dispatcher). The remaining arguments are supplied when the command is sent, for example, from the F Prime ground data system (GDS). The implementation code does the following:

1. Emit telemetry and events.

2. Invoke the `mathOpOut` port to request that `MathReceiver`
perform the operation.

3. Send a command response indicating success.
The command response goes out on the special port
`cmdResponseOut`.

In F Prime, every execution of a command handler must end by sending a command response.
The proper behavior of other framework components (e.g., command dispatcher, command sequencer) depends upon adherence to this rule. 


Check the build using:


```shell
# In: MathSender
fprime-util build
```

## Editing the Result Handler 
The handler `mathResultIn_handler` is called when the `MathReceiver` component code returns a result by invoking the `mathResultIn` port. Again the handler overrides the corresponding pure virtual function in the auto-generated base class. Fill in the handler so that it looks like this:

```cpp
// In: MathSender.cpp
void MathSender ::
  mathResultIn_handler(
      const NATIVE_INT_TYPE portNum,
      F32 result
  )
{
    this->tlmWrite_RESULT(result);
    this->log_ACTIVITY_HI_RESULT(result);
}
```

## Explanation 

The implementation code emits the result on the `RESULT` telemetry channel and as a `RESULT` event report.


Check the build using:

```shell
# In: MathSender
fprime-util build
```

## Summary
Congratulations, you have completed `MathSender`! Well... there's always more to be done, such as error handling, adding more telemetry,
creating more events, and generally messing around with what `MathSender` can do. But for the purposes of getting a deployment
working, this component is done!
