## Bootstrapping F´

> Note: if you have followed the [HelloWorld tutorial](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-hello-world/) previously, this should feel very familiar...

An F´ project ties to a specific version of tools to work with F´.  In order to create a project and install the correct version of tools, an initial bootstrap version of F´ tools must be installed. This is accomplished with the following command:

```bash
pip install fprime-tools
```

## Creating a New F´ Project

Now that to tools are installed a new F´ project can be created. An F´ project internalizes the version of F´ that
the project will build upon and provides the user the basic setup for creating, building, and testing components.

In order to make a new project, run the following command and answer the questions as indicated below:

```bash
fprime-util new --project
```

This command will ask for some input. Respond with the following answers:
```
project_name [MyProject]: MathProject
fprime_branch_or_tag [devel]: devel
Select install_venv:
1 - yes
2 - no
Choose from 1, 2 [1]: 1
```

Use the default for anything not specified. This command will take a moment to run.

The above command creates a new F´ project structure in a folder called `MathProject`, use the `devel` branch of F´ as
the basis for the project, and set up the matching tools in a new Virtual Environment.

> Note: that we have not yet created a deployment, but rather just the base project structure.

## Building the New F´ Project

The next step is to set up and build the newly created project. This will serve as a build environment for any newly
created components, and will build the F´ framework supplied components.

```bash
cd MathProject
fprime-util generate
fprime-util build -j4
```

> `fprime-util generate` sets up the build environment for a project/deployment. It only needs to be done once. At the
> end of this tutorial, a new deployment will be created and `fprime-util generate` will also be used then.

## Summary

A new project has been created with the name `MathProject` and has been placed in a new folder called in `MathProject` in
the current directory. It includes the initial build system setup, and F´ version. It is still empty in that the user
will still need to create components and deployments.

For the remainder of this Getting Started tutorial we should use the tools installed for our project and issue commands
within this new project's folder. Change into the project directory and load the newly install tools with:

```bash
cd MathProject
. venv/bin/activate
```
